TODO: make auth module.

create users (one to start)

the user make registers of metalTypes:
the user make registers of ItemTypes

the user make a request:
 - the request is registered into its table(name, lastName, date).
 - before the request is registered, 
    first is registered a new jewerly where its ObjectId will be taken to the new request.

when a jewerly register is created:
    (
        invoices=null, 
        itemType[ObjectId], 
        metalType[ObjectId],
        user[ObjectId],
    )
